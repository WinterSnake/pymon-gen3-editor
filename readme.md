# Pokemon Gen III Save Editor
This repo is just to explore the save data format of generation 3 Pokemon games. Pieced together from information from the [wiki](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Save_data_structure_%28Generation_III%29) and from the disassembled/decompiled games of [Leaf Green/Fire Red](https://github.com/pret/pokefirered), [Ruby/Sapphire](https://github.com/pret/pokeruby) and [Emerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald).
